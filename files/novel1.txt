Years later, when a powerful storm isolated the island for weeks, Ravi quietly took responsibility for organizing supplies.
Rather than ordering others, he mapped food reserves and suggested routes that avoided unstable ground.
When a group of younger islanders argued about stealing from a neighboring village, Ravi intervened calmly, reminding them of past tragedies.
He spent nights watching the sea, calculating when it would be safe for a small boat to leave the island.
Eventually, Ravi guided a group across the water using the stars he had studied since childhood, never resorting to force, even when fear spread among them.

Ravi grew up on a remote island where travel beyond the coast was rare and dangerous.
As a child, he learned to survive by observing tides, memorizing stars, and avoiding conflict.
After witnessing a violent feud destroy two families, Ravi vowed never to raise his hand in anger.
He believed that patience and careful planning were the only ways to endure hardship.
Because of this, he became known among the islanders as someone who preferred silence over confrontation and foresight over bravery.
